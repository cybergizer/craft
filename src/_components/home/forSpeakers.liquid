        Euruko is being organized for the past 20 years by Ruby developers for Ruby developers. Itâ€™s a truly
        volunteer-based event and like Ruby it is fostered by the community. Our attendees enjoy its informal atmosphere and lots of opportunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.
