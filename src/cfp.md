ðŸ’¡**The CFP is open from the 1st of April to the 31th of May 2023**

Euruko is being organized for the past 20 years by Ruby developers for Ruby developers. Itâ€™s a truly volunteer-based event and like Ruby it is fostered by the community. Our attendees enjoy its informal atmosphere and lots of opportunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.

**What do we want to hear from you?**

Weâ€™re looking for a wide range of topics related to Ruby, coding, and everything related to that. Weâ€™re aiming to have a balance of talks aimed at diverse levels of expertise.
